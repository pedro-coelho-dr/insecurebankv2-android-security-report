## Getting started

### InsecureBankV2

Download the Latest APK from the InsecureBankV2 repository:  

[InsecureBankV2](https://github.com/dineshshetty/Android-InsecureBankv2)

Transfer the APK to Genymotion by dragging and dropping the file into the emulator or using ADB:

```bash
adb install InsecureBankv2.apk
```

### Genymotion

Download and install [Genymotion Desktop](https://www.genymotion.com/)

Configure an Android device, this project uses the following environment:
 
**Environment**  
- Host Machine: *Windows 11, Intel i7, 32GB RAM, with the latest security updates applied.*  
- Emulator: *Genymotion Desktop Version 3.7.1*, configured to emulate a *Samsung Galaxy S8* with *Android 10.0.*  
- Network Environment: The Genymotion emulator is connected to the internet via the host machine. A manual proxy is configured to route traffic through security testing tools. The InsecureBankV2 app communicates with an external server using the IP and port provided by the instructor.


### MobSF

Run locally:
```bash
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```
```bash
https://localhost:8000
```

Alternatively, run online:

[MobSF Online](https://mobsf.live/)


### Burp Suite

Download and Install [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

Install the [Burp Certificate](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/mobile/config-android-device) on the Android device. 

Set up the proxy in Burp Suite

### ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

Install ADB on your machine.

In Kali Linux, install ADB using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install adb
```

For general instructions, refer to the [Android Developer Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).

Connect to your Genymotion emulator:
    
```bash
adb connect <emulator_ip>:<port>
```

Access the shell:
    
```bash
adb shell
```

### Jadx
Install Jadx on your machine.
For general instructions, refer to the [Jadx GitHub Repository](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

On Kali Linux, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt install jadx
```
Open the GUI:
```bash	
jadx-gui
```


### Frida

Download the appropriate Frida-server binary for your emulator:  
[Frida Releases](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases)

This project used the following Frida-server binaries:
```bash
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.4.8/frida-server-16.4.8-android-x86.xz
```
```bash
unxz frida-server-16.4.8-android-x86.xz
```
```bash
adb push frida-server-16.4.8-android-x86 /data/local/tmp/
```
Connect to the ADB shell, navigate to the directory, change permissions, and run the server:
```bash
cd /data/local/tmp/
```
```bash
adb shell chmod 777 frida-server-16.4.8-android-x86
```
```bash
./frida-server-16.4.8-android-x86
```

### Objection

Install Objection:

For further information, refer to the [Objection GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sensepost/objection)

```bash
pip3 install objection
```

To see the running processes on the device:

```bash
